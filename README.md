# Whatsapp_Message_Automation

Developed to support Aveti Learning operations for online education during and after COVID-19.

*** work in progress ***

Once you have downloaded the files, run whatsapp.py from the terminal by using the command `python3 whatsapp.py`.

You will be prompted to enter the groups names to send the message to. The first time you run this program, you will need
to enter all of the group names by hand, but the following times, the groups are stored, so if you are sending messages to the same groups, 
you don't need to re-enter. In addition, you need to scan the QR code the first time around, but once you do that, the corresponding cookies are 
stored, preventing the need to scan a QR code every time. 

Scheduler is finicky and is being improved upon.
